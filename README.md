# NLP Comment Classification Model

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and resources for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on classifying Net Promoter Score (NPS) comments. The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically categorize and label NPS comments into predefined categories. This README provides an outline of the project, its contents, and instructions for using and extending the model.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the classification model. It includes both the raw NPS comments and their corresponding labels.

- **notebook**: This directory holds Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project

3. Explore the `notebook` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation process.

4. Run the notebook to replicate the project pipeline. Adjust parameters and experiment as needed.
